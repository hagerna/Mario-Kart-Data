        <h1>The Data</h1>
        <p class="headerDescription">
          The initial idea that started this was to take a more methodical
          approach to playing MarioKart on the Nintendo Switch; to see which
          characters we were each best with by trying them all. And in order to
          go about it in a serious manner we would need to track that data.
          <br />
          It almost immediately became apparent how many variables we would need
          to keep track of if we wanted to take it seriously. There were the
          obvious: which character, vehicle, wheels and glider we were using,
          the map where the race took place, and most importantly the placement
          which is what would serve as the metric of success. Additionally
          however, there are a number of other settings that can be changed: the
          speed of the race, the difficulty of the computer opponents, whether
          auto-steering and auto-driving are enabled, stick versus tilt
          steering, and even the color of the controller used. As we continued,
          other data we included was whether the loadout was randomized, the
          number of racers that competed, and the date on which we raced.
